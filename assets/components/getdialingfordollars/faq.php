                            <p>Due to the overwhelmingly positive results we create in each workshop I know the Inner Circle will sell out in record time. But to be fair and give everyone an equal opportunity to participate, I've added an Outer Circle.</p>

                            <p>Before I explain, picture this for a moment&hellip;<br>It’s Graduation day and you're exhilarated and tingling with excitement as you hang up the phone from our final session with extreme confidence knowing that you possess all of the skills, tools and strategies to prospect and build like the Pros.</p>
                            <p>You are exhilarated and tingling with excitement as you hang up the phone from our final session with extreme confidence knowing that you possess all of the skills, tools and strategies to prospect and build like the Pro’s.</p>
                            <p> In just 5 days, you've progressed from newbie to PRO status because you dove right in and participated. You played full out. You committed to your success!</p>
                            <p>And these new skills, this new attitude, are part of your DNA!</p>
                            <p> It's you! It’s your potential, finally realized! And it’s duplicable! You can hardly wait to attract and lead others on your road to personal success and fulfillment!</p>
                            <p> This isn’t some fluff-a-nutta business…it’s a real business, serving real people, with a real earning potential.</p>
                            <p> And now, you can't wait to show your family and friends and business prospects because you know it’s real! If they don’t see it, it’s their loss. You now focus on only the right people, with the right attitude. The Success Train is leaving the station and you are fully on board!</p>
                            <p> If you can picture this kind of success attitude for yourself and if you can picture making the investment to spend 5  sessions (11 hours total) working with me to dive in and master your prospecting skills with LIVE prospects then I invite you to participate in this workshop by clicking the link below and locking in your seat for either the Inner Circle or the Outer Circle.</p>
